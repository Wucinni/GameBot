Simple bot for M2 to send key inputs, automate mouse movement and detect images on screen.

It is able to:
1. Send keys input at intervals of time {1-4; f1-f4, z, enter}.
2. Automate mouse movement: it can move mouse to coordinates received from detection functions and use left click.
3. Detect images on screen for items, buttons and NPCs.

# Getting Started

## Documentation
   
It is split in 2 version:
1. LevelBot which is able to press keys and click on revive button and auto-attack window implemented in game
2. EnergyBot which is able to grind energy fragments by putting them on the alchemist; EnergyBot is semi-automated since it still needs user assistance and monitoring

## Roadmap

Future updates will include bugfixes, optimization and single window focus in background.
